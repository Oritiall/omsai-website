# skill-scout

The safety layer for growing your Claude Code setup. Every directory online ranks **popularity**;
none tells you if an extension will read your `.env` or rug-pull after you trust it. skill-scout
adds the missing signal: it finds the good ones **and vets them**.

`SKILL_DIR` below = the folder this file lives in. Run the CLI as
`python3 SKILL_DIR/scripts/scout.py ...` (no `cd` needed). Requires Python 3.9+ and git; the `gh`
CLI is optional but removes GitHub rate limits.

## Golden rules (never break)

1. **Never promise "safe".** This is static analysis + reputation. Always give the caveat
   (`references/verdict-template.md`) and separate "**what I scanned in the code**" (facts) from
   "**what is a reputation signal**" (inference).
2. **Never install without explicit approval**, and never offer install for **band 4-5**.
3. **SHA-pin every install** and record it, so a future update can be re-vetted (rug-pull defense).
4. **Respond in the user's language.** No em-dashes - use a hyphen.
5. The vetter never runs the cloned code. Don't work around that.

## Mode A - Discover ("find me a skill for…")

Use when the user wants ideas, or has a goal but not a specific repo.

**1. Understand them first (don't ask what you can read).**
Skim their Claude Code setup: `CLAUDE.md`, any memory file, recent history, installed extensions.
Form a one-line hypothesis of what they do and where an extension could help.

**2. Ask 2-4 sharp questions** (use AskUserQuestion). Pick what's actually unclear:
- General sweep or a specific idea in mind?
- The goal behind it (what would "great" look like)?
- Which ecosystems are in scope - Skills / MCP servers / plugins / commands? (default: all)
- Any hard constraints (no cloud, no API key, must be free)?

**3. Translate intent to English search terms** - the directories are English-indexed, even if
the user writes in another language.

**4. Run discovery** (once per ecosystem in scope):
```
python3 SKILL_DIR/scripts/scout.py discover "<english query>" --eco skill --limit 8
```
`--eco` ∈ skill | mcp | plugin | command. Returns JSON: ranked candidates each with `score`
(0-100 Tier-1 reputation), `score_band`, stars, source, repo_url, `requires_code_execution`.

**5. Present the shortlist** per `references/verdict-template.md` (table: # · name · what it does ·
outputs · score 1-100 · why/why-not · link), in the user's language. State plainly that the score
is **reputation, not a code audit**. Close by offering a deep vet on any of them.

---

## Mode B - Vet ("is this safe?")

Use when the user names a specific extension, or picks one from the shortlist.

**1. Run the deep static scan:**
```
python3 SKILL_DIR/scripts/scout.py vet <repo_url> [--ref <branch-or-sha>]
```
Returns JSON: `band` (1-5), `band_label`, `sha` (the exact commit scanned), `findings`
(category · severity · file:line · snippet), `green_flags`, `severity_counts`.

**2. Adjudicate findings yourself (this is the LLM half of "hybrid").**
- **band 1-2:** trust the scan. Summarize.
- **band 3+ or any HIGH/CRITICAL:** do NOT just relay the scanner. **Read the actual flagged
  lines** (fetch the file - raw GitHub URL or `git show`) and judge real-vs-false-positive. The
  scanner is deliberately trigger-happy; your job is to confirm intent.
- **Borderline trust:** escalate reputation - a quick `WebSearch`/`WebFetch` on the publisher +
  repo (or spawn a research subagent) for incidents, age, who they are.

**3. Give the final verdict** per `references/verdict-template.md`: risk band + label, the **code
facts**, the **reputation signal**, green flags, one honest bottom line, and the **mandatory
caveat**. Optionally collapse to a 1/2/3 shorthand (rubric) but keep the 1-5 band in any record.

**4. Scoring meaning** lives in `references/scoring-rubric.md`; the detection rules in
`references/threat-model.md`. Read them if unsure how a number was reached.

## Install on approval (only after a vet)

For **band 1-2** (or band 3 the user explicitly accepts after your review):
```
python3 SKILL_DIR/scripts/scout.py install <repo_url> --name <name> --sha <sha> --band <N> --score <N>
```
This clones the **exact vetted commit** into `~/.claude/skills/<name>/`, strips `.git` (static
copy), records it in `~/.claude/skill-scout/registry.json`, and reports whether a `SKILL.md`
loaded. Then tell the user: it's pinned to `<sha>`; if it updates later, ask skill-scout to re-vet
before pulling the new version.

- **MCP / plugins (Phase 2):** `install` returns the exact `claude mcp add` / `/plugin install`
  command for the user to run - it does **not** auto-execute these yet. Hand them the command +
  your verdict; never run it silently.
- **band 4-5:** never offer install. State it's not recommended and why, in one clear line.

## Honesty discipline

- Mark every claim: scanned-in-code vs reputation-signal.
- "Clean scan" = "no known red flags found", **not** "proven safe". Say it that way.
- If a source failed or returned nothing (e.g. a flaky directory), say so - don't imply full
  coverage.

## Scope notes
- This release fully covers the **Skills** ecosystem (discover + vet + install). MCP / plugins /
  commands: discovery works now; deep MCP-poisoning + hooks scanning and auto-install are planned.
  Be honest about that boundary when asked.
- Sources are config: `references/sources.yaml`. The skills.sh audit is a cross-check, never sole
  truth.
